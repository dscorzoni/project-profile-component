## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time playing around with borders and overlaying images, so it was important to learn about position absolute/relative. Also, I had a bit of trouble to figure out responsiveness of background SVGs, so using position: fixed looked to be a reasonable solution.

### Useful resources

- [Images Overlay](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-image-overlays-css/) - This was a useful guide to understand about position: absolute/relative on using to position the profile picture over the background header.

- [Letter-spacing](https://cssreference.io/property/letter-spacing/) - A quick guide to change the default on letter spacing for displaying the text below the stats.
